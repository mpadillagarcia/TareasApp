# TareasApp
This repository presents a practical example of a web application developed with Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to create, delete, modify, and view individual tasks, each with customizable titles and descriptions during creation or editing.

The application follows a software design pattern such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) or MVP (Model-View-Presenter) for an organized and scalable architecture. The main components, including the controller, view, model, and viewmodel (if using MVP), are implemented in a clear and structured manner.

Key features:

- Task Management: Users can create new tasks with personalized titles and descriptions and also delete or modify existing tasks.
- Interactive User Interface: The UI is intuitive and appealing, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.
- MVC/MVP Design Pattern: The application follows an architecture based on the MVC or MVP pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and efficient code organization.
- Dynamism: Tasks are displayed dynamically, reflecting updates automatically in the interface without the need to reload the page.

This repository serves as an excellent foundation for learning web development with Node.js and the implementation of software design patterns like MVC or MVP. Through this task management application, developers can familiarize themselves with the best practices and techniques used in modern web development.
